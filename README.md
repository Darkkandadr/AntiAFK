# AntiAFK
AntiAFK plugin for Minecraft servers.

Designed for 1.8.8 servers not tested on other versions.
- Antirejoin
- Changeable items
- Changeable trigger blocks
- Changeable kick options

It has a license system, you can remove it from the main class 'Antiafk'. License api is closed already.
That was my first plugin attempt, do not take it seriously.
